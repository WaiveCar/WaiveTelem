CASE ORDERING

To do a production run with the case components:
1. Download the latest file version (007 as of writing).
2. Send 02001-007.STL and 02004-007.STL to sales@rexroi.com and ask them for a quote to print with the quantity needed. They should quote around $10 per pair.
3. Wait a few days until they email you telling you the pieces are done.
4. Pick the units up from their location in DTLA or have them shipped.
