sim slot moved, profile shorter, zip tie holes, give room for slotting top to bottom, potentially make the coax ports bottom border higher, led indicator holes bigger, usb hole bigger, sticker 1 inch wider

dead space underneath board is 2mm (bottom boss height)

bottom part: ?69mm x ?91mm, wall thickness 1.5mm, bottom thickness 2.2mm
bottom 2.2mm walls 1.5mm, top 2.2mm

#do bottom standoffs as squares, sim corner as square with fillet
do bottom and top standoffs as hollow bosses with boss supports to wall. supports double as locators

sim slot placed properly for flipped sim

zip tie holes: one side curved enclosed channel

slotting top to bottom: top OD is 2.05mm
remained at 2mm on actual TBD

coax bottom border: 6.5+1+.5 change dimension
coax bottom border kept same

led indicators 1.5x1.5
done (actual 1.4x1.4, new is .7r circle)

usb hole https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_hardware
the Micro-B connector is 6.85 by 1.8 mm (0.270 by 0.071 in) with a maximum overmold size of 10.6 by 8.5 mm (0.42 by 0.33 in).
done

holes: top: 1.8mm diameter NEW 2.0mm. bottom: 2.3mm diameter NEW: 2.6mm
done as  2.6 through holes with 6mm boss (dia), 1.9 mounting holes with 2.5 boss (dia)

draft .5 degree \____/ as such on both sides
draft 1 degree the long threading holes
draft before fillet



q's
tolerances: ridges, screw holes, screw head slot
inner cut, e.g. a hook or two conflicting slots
if i do xyz (e.g. the hook) will it increase tooling costs or production complexity
polishing

slot corners (top standoff squares): should they have a fillet radius



uniform wall thickness
walls to base should be 50%
3mm bottom, side 60% of 3mm

holes with boss to sidewalls. these bosses can also be locators for the lid sides
